A python script used to keep backups of data.

It's directed to two top-level directories. One is the "accumulate" directory
and the other is an "overwrite" directory. 
The former should contain file types that are rarely or never modified, such as
videos, audio files, books, etc.
The latter should contain often-modified files such as text documents, source
code and other.
